This version of Vivianne is an early build, so some features might be incomplete or unstable. Please hold off on using Vivianne for any mods you plan to release just yet.

The UX/UI, feature set, and tools are all subject to change. Keep this in mind, as you might get a bit lost while I work on creating an easy-to-use interface for saving files. You can "close" the current file by clicking the arrow to the left of the Minimize button. This behavior is likely to stick, but the button might change positions to better align with other modern Windows 11 apps.

BNK parsing is still not available. I just don't have enough time to get to it. It might come, or it might not. I'm not sure how many features I want to support when trying to edit these kind of files just yet.

Support for NFS4 is currently in the works. You can open NFS4 VIV files and edit FeData4 and (to some extent) Carp files. FSH files will open, but if they use a local color palette (which, is somewhat common in cars for NFS4 honestly) you'll get a glitchy mess of pixels. This is due to how I was originally handling palette loading when Vivianne was NFS3 exclusive. Will need to rework it. FCE4 files are being internally parsed, but no UI editor has been implemented yet. I wanted to rewrite how I define things so I can reuse the FCE3 view instead of having to copy and paste a lot of code. I'll try to get full FCE4 editing support for the next alpha release.

By the way, FCE4 support also includes Motor City Online models! As a proof of concept that will stick around, I've included a tool to convert files from FCE4 to FCE3 that supports both NFS4 and MCO FCE files.

As for <insert your favorite old EA title from the era that still uses simmilar file formats>... That's probably not going to happen. I might give it a shot, but I can't guarantee support for them.

This preview is for evaluation purposes only... You've been warned!

Happy modding.
